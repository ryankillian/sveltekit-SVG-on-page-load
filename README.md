# sveltekit-with-SVG

The SVG runs as an 'intro page' for the site.

Demo at https://sveltekit-svg-intro.surge.sh/

This is a basic starter sveltekit app with 3 page navigation.

This nice effect is easy to implement with the help of Svelte's inbuilt animations.

import { draw } from 'svelte/transition';
